<!-- About: The viewer is seeing a chart which displays the number of rides per month in Bend,  OR in 2017. 
I chose to display this data because Bend has such distinct weather changes, so I assumed that number of rides would decrease dramatically in the Winter months.
To display the chart, the application gets the data from an online database, using the jQuery library. 
The code that I modified specifies which data to pull, parase, and then display to the viewer, resulting in this beautiful line graph. -->
